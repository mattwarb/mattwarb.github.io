    <p>
        I am a recent physics graduate who is trying to learn how to code properly,
        as physicists are crap teachers if I'm being honest.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will be a repository for all my coding priojects while learning at QA
        and eventually to be my online portfolio of projects once I git good (haha get it) at all this.
    </p>
    <p>
        My hobbies include:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Football
            </li>
            <li>
                Kicking the ball with your foot
            </li>
            <li>
                When the ball hits your foot
            </li>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        My genuine hobbies include:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Podcasts. I listen to many and even have made my own with a friend on Liverpool FC, off which I based the colour
                scheme and theme of this site. Our soundlcoud is <a <color="white" href="https://soundcloud.com/user-947388717"> here </color></a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Physics. I've spent the last 6 years of my life with the dream
                of being a researcher and I will not lie, I miss it and try to keep up to date
                in what is going on in physics
            </li>
            <li>
                Genuinely football. I consume all I can and try to play as often as possible despite being a fat lump
            </li>

        </ul>
    </p>
