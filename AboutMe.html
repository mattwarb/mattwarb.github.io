        <p>
            Recently graduating with a Masters in Physics from the University of Liverpool, and after a year on
            a particle physics PhD programme, I am ready to enter in to a career outside of academia. During
            my time in the PhD programme I gained great experience and new skills, which I believe would
            be vital to any career. I am a very driven person with a highly analytical mind and a passion for
            learning new skills and working with others, and believe I would make a great addition to any team.
